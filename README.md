# working-with-apis
Assignment from The Odin Project's Javascript course, [Working with APIs](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-working-with-apis).

At this point, I'm quite familiar with using fetch API, but I thought it would be good for me to do this anyway, just in case I missed any fundamentals.

## Brief
1. Expand on our little project here by adding a button that fetches a new image without refreshing the page.
2. Add a search box so users can search for specific gifs. You should also investigate adding a .catch() to the end of the promise chain in case Giphy doesnâ€™t find any gifs with the searched keyword. Add a default image, or an error message if the search fails.
3. (From the next lesson) convert the promise based code into `async/await` compatible code.
